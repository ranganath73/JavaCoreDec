/**
 * You need to write a program that:
 * 
 * Reads an integer N from the console.
 * If the number N is greater than 0, then the program reads an additional N integers.
 * Print the numbers to the console. If N is odd, display them in the order in which 
 * there were entered. Otherwise, display them in reverse order.
 * Display each number on a new line. Do not display the number N.
 * 
 * Requirements:
 * •	The program should read a number N, followed by N numbers.
 * •	The class must have a public static void main (String[]) method.
 * •	Do not add new methods to the Solution class.
 * •	If N is even, then the program should display N numbers in reverse order.
 * •	If N is odd, then the program should display N numbers in the order in which they were entered.
