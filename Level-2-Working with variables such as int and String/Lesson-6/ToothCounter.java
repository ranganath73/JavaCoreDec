/**
 * Using only the decrement operator, change the value of the toothCounter variable so that 
 * number 23 is displayed.
 * 
 * Requirements:
 * •	Do not change the statement that declares the toothCounter variable.
 * •	You need to apply the decrement operator to the toothCounter variable several 
 *      times so that its value becomes 23.
 * •	The program must display the toothCounter variable with a value of 23.
