/**
 * Let's implement a calculator that will compute the powers of numbers.
 *
 * To do this, create a cube() method. It must take a long integer value as an argument.
 * The method should raise the passed value to the third power and return it as the method's result.
 * The numbers you have to work with may be large. Accordingly, the cube() method must return a long.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * •	There must be a public static long cube(long) method.
 * •	The cube() method must return the result of raising the passed number to the power of three.
