/**
 * Here is the Earth class — a collection of variables that describe certain characteristics 
 * of the planet Earth.
 * Be sure that the variables of the Earth class are global constants. 
 * Don't forget to rename the variables so that they comply with code style 
 * conventions for global variables.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * •	The Earth class's name variable needs to be changed into a global variable.
 * •	The Earth class's square variable needs to be changed into a global variable.
 * •	The Earth class's population variable needs to be changed into a global variable.
 * •	The Earth class's equatorLength variable needs to be changed into a global variable.
