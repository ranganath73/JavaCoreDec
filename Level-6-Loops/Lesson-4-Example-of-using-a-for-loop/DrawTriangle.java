/**
 * Let's use a for loop to display a right triangle comprised of numeral eights with sides (legs) 
 * of 10 and 10.
 * In other words, the first line should contain one 8, forming the left side. 
 * The second line should have two 8s, etc.
 * 
 * Example screen output:
 * 8
 * 88
 * 888
 * 8888
 * 88888
 * 888888
 * 8888888
 * 88888888
 * 888888888
 * 8888888888
 *
 * Requirements:
 * •	The program should display numbers on the screen.
 * •	The program should display a right triangle comprised of numeral eights with sides 10 and 10.
 * •	The program must use a for loop.
 * •	The screen output should happen in a for loop.
