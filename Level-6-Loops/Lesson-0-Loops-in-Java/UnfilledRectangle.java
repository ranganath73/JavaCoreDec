/**
 * Using nested while loops (a loop within a loop), 
 * display an unfilled rectangle (just an outline) that is 10 (height) 
 * by 20 (width) and made from the letter 'B'.
 * 
 * The unfilled part consists of spaces.
 *
 * Example output:
 * BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
 * B                  B
 * B                  B
 * B                  B
 * B                  B
 * B                  B
 * B                  B
 * B                  B
 * B                  B
 * BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
 * 
 * Requirements:
 * •	The program should display text on the screen.
 * •	The program should draw the outline of a rectangle with a height of 10 and a width of 20, 
 *      made from the letter 'B'.
 * •	The program must use nested while loops (a loop in a loop).
 * •	The screen output must happen in a while loop.
