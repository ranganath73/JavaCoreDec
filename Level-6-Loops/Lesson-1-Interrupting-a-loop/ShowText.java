/**
 * We enter data from the keyboard and immediately display it on the screen 
 * until the word "enough" is entered.
 * 
 * Do not output the word "enough".
 * To do this, you need to use an infinite loop (while(true)).
 *
 * Hint: To terminate an infinite loop, use a break statement.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * •	The program should read data from the keyboard.
 * •	The program must use a while loop.
 * •	To terminate an infinite loop, you need to use a break statement.
 * •	The program should display all the entered data, each read line on a new line, 
 *      until the word "enough" is entered.
