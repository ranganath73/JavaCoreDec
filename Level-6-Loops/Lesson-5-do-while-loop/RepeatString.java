 * Use the keyboard to read a string and a number (number variable) that is greater than 0 and less than 5.
 * Display the string number times using a do-while loop. Display each value on a new line.
 * If the value read in for the number variable is less than or equal to 0 or greater than or equal to 5, then the entered string must be displayed once.
 * 
 * Example input:
 * abc

 * 
 * Example output:
 * abc
 * abc
 * 
 * Requirements:
 * •	The program should read data from the keyboard.
 * •	The program should display data on the screen.
 * •	The program should display the string number times.
 * •	The program should display the string once if number is less than or equal to 0 or greater
