/**
 * To solve this task, you need to:
 *
 * Read a positive radius integer from the keyboard. This represents the radius of a circle.
 * Display the area of the circle, calculated using this formula: Area = pi * radius * radius.
 * The result should be an integer (int type). To do this, you need to cast the multiplication 
 * result to an int (discard the fractional part, rounding down to an integer).
 * Use 3.14 as the value for pi.
 * 
 * Clarification:
 * If a negative number was entered, then don't display anything on the screen.
 * Example input:
 * 5
 *
 * Example output:
 * 78
 * 
 * Requirements:
 * •	The program should read an integer from the keyboard.
 * •	The program should display a number on the screen.
 * •	The program should display the area of the circle with a radius equal to the radius variable. 
 *      The area must be converted to an integer.
