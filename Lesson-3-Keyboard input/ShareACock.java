/**
 * Let's share a case of icy cola at the office. To do this, we will write a program 
 * with these requirements:
 *
 * You need to read two integers from the keyboard. The first number is the number of 
 * cola cans in a case. The second is the number of people at the office.
 * Display the result of dividing the first number by the second.
 * The result should be a real number.
 * Example input:
 * 3
 * 2
 * 
 * Example output:
 * 1.5
 *
 * Requirements:
 * •	The program should read integers from the keyboard.
 * •	The program should display a number on the screen.
 * •	The program should display a real number — the result of dividing the first integer 
 *      entered by the second.
