/**
 * There is a program that takes an age as input and determines whether 
 * you need to head to school or to college. But it doesn't work correctly. 
 * For example, a five-year-old child is sent off to college! 
 * It isn't difficult to fix the program: just put curly braces in the right place.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * •	The program should read a number from the keyboard.
 * •	The program must use the System.out.println() or System.out.print() command.
 * •	If the age is less than 18 and greater than or equal to 6, you should display 
 *          only "Off to school with you, my child".
 * •	If the age is greater than or equal to 18, you should display only 
 *          "Your college class starts soon".
 * •	If the age is less than 6, then don't display anything.
