/**
 * Enter two integers from the keyboard that will be the coordinates of a point. 
 * The first number is the x coordinate, and the second is the y coordinate). 
 * The point must not lie on the X or Y axes.
 * Display the number of the quadrant that contains the given point.
 *
 * Hint:
 * Point (x, y) belongs to a quadrant if the following conditions are true:
 * 
 * for the first quadrant — x > 0 and y > 0;
 * for the second quadrant — x < 0 and y > 0;
 * for the third quadrant — x < 0 and y < 0;
 * for the fourth quadrant — x > 0 and y < 0.
 * 
 * Example for the numbers 4 6:
 * 1
 * Example for the numbers -6 -6:
 * 3
 *
 * Requirements:
 * •	The program should read two number from the keyboard.
 * •	The program must use the System.out.println() or System.out.print() command.
