/**
 * Let's write a program that will read an age from the keyboard. 
 * If the age is in the range from 20 to 60 (inclusive), then don't display anything. 
 * Otherwise, display the phrase "You don't have to work". 
 * You can (and must!) do this with only one if statement (without an else block).
 * 
 * Hint: use the || (OR) boolean operator.
 * 
 * Requirements:
 * •	The program should read one number from the keyboard.
 * •	If the age is less than 20 or more than 60, then you need to display the phrase 
 *          "You don't have to work".
 * •	If the age is in the range from 20 to 60 (inclusive), then don't display anything.
 * •	The program must use a single if statement without an else block and must use the 
 *          || logical operator.
