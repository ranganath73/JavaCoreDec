/**
 * Use the keyboard to enter three integers. 
 * Determine whether there is at least one pair of equal numbers among them.
 * 
 * If such a pair exists, display the numbers separated by spaces. 
 * If all three numbers are equal, then display all three.
 *
 * Examples:
 * a) if we enter the numbers 1 2 2, then the output we get is 2 2
 * 
 * b) if we enter the numbers 2 2 2, then the output we get is 2 2 2
 * 
 * Requirements:
 * •	The program should read three number from the keyboard.
 * •	The program must contain System.out.println() or System.out.print().
 * •	If two numbers are equal, you need to display them on the screen.
 * •	If all three numbers are equal, you need to display all three.
 * •	If none of the numbers are equal, then display nothing.
