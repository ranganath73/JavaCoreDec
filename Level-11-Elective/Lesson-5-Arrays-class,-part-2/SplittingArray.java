/**
 * Implement the main(String[]) method, which splits an array into two subarrays 
 * and fills a two-dimensional result array with them.
 * 
 * If the length of the array is odd, then the larger half should be 
 * copied into the first subarray.
 *
 * Use the Arrays.copyOfRange(int[], int, int) method to split the array. 
 * Do not change the order of the elements.
 * 
 * During testing, the values of the fields in the Solution class will be different. 
 * Take that into consideration.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * â€¢	Implement the main(String[]) method in accordance with the task conditions.
