/**
 * A public string field is declared and initialized in the Solution class. 
 * But the string is too long and difficult to read.
 * 
 * For better readability, you need to split it into 5 substrings and 
 * concatenate them with the "+" (string concatenation) operator, like this:
 *
 * first line: "Always write code as if "
 * second line: "the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be "
 * third line: "a violent psychopath "
 * fourth line: "who knows where you live. "
 * fifth line: "Martin Golding"
 * 
 * Requirements:
 * â€¢	Change the text field according to the task conditions.
