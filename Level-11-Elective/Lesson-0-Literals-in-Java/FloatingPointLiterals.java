/**
 * Seven public fields are declared and initialized in the Solution class.
 * They are initialized with various values stored in floating point literals.
 *
 * But the program doesn't compile, and you need to fix it.
 * To do this, change the field types so they match the values. 
 * Do not change the field names or values.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * •	Change the type of the a field so that the program compiles.
 * •	Change the type of the b field so that the program compiles.
 * •	Change the type of the c field so that the program compiles.
 * •	Change the type of the d field so that the program compiles.
 * •	Change the type of the e field so that the program compiles.
 * •	Change the type of the f field so that the program compiles.
 * •	Change the type of the g field so that the program compiles.
